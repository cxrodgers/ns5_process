This repository contains a variety of objects all revolving around 
filling OpenElectrophy databases with raw data from ns5 files, 
and then interacting with those databases.


Main Files (primary purpose: creating and interacting with OE)
KlustaKwikIO : dumps spike times to KK format, should be put into OE/neo
RecordingSession : reads and writes from folder with all the data
car_subtract : preps data for spike sorting, should go into RecordingSession
ns5 : handles reading from ns5 file
plot_avg_lfp : add to RecordingSession
spiketime_dump : add to RecordingSession


Main file (make OE not required):
SpikeTrainContainers : holds spike trains, should use Picker for this
SpikeTrainEnsemble : holds spike trains



Expt-specific ugliness (should go into a different repo just for me)
RecordingSessionMaker : makes well-formed RecordingSessions, handles
    the peculiarities of my experiments.
add_btrial_numbers : adds btrial numbers, should be split into RecordingSession
    and RecordingSessionMaker
bcontrol : loads my data from bcontrol matfiles
check_audio_waveforms : checks alignment
AudioTools - detecting audio onsets



Deprecated
DataSession - Contains BehavingSyncer for syncing timestamps from behavior
    and neural, should go into RecordingSessionMaker
NeuralDataGrabber - Became RecordingSessionMaker
SU_make_psth - Became SpikeTrainContainers and SpikeTrainEnsemble
generate_timestamps - Added to RecordingSessionMaker
